title: NanoKVM Desk LCD Screen Malfunction
---

## Applicable Scenarios

1. Screen fails to display properly: No logo appears on startup, but the orange LED on the back blinks normally.
2. Touchscreen malfunctions: No response regardless of tapping, long pressing, or swiping.

## Cause of Issue

The NanoKVM Desk may experience display anomalies due to the FPC flex cable of the screen becoming dislodged or having poor contact as a result of transportation jolts.

## Repair Steps

> ❗❗❗The following steps involve disassembly, which carries risks. Please read the steps carefully before proceeding with caution❗❗❗

**Materials Required**

1. NanoKVM Desk with screen malfunction
2. Screwdriver
3. Thin shim (a piece of paper can be used as an alternative)
4. Tweezers

**Detailed Steps**

1. Peel off the two silicone pads at the bottom (applying a slight diagonal pull can prevent adhesive residue); unscrew the four screws. Note that the screws near the screen side are two short self-tapping screws, while the ones near the rear interface are two long M2 screws. Keep the pads and screws safe.

2. The screen bracket is secured to the anodized aluminum casing by four clips at the bottom and top. Start by prying open the screen cover from the bottom, then from the top.

> ❗❗❗This step is high-risk and may cause the screen flex cable at the bottom to break. Please control the force applied❗❗❗

8. Screw everything back together, using the shorter screws near the screen side and the longer screws near the interface side; finally, reattach the foot pads.
