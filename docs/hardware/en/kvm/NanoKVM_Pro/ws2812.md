## Installation Steps

### Confirm Installation Orientation

> Segment ④ is optional. You can choose between three-sided or four-sided mode based on your needs.
>
> The sampling order of the strip is: **Bottom-left → Top-left → Top-right → Bottom-right → Bottom-left**.
> Ensure consistency during installation. The green end is the strip’s Type-C connector, and the other end connects to NanoKVM-Pro via the adapter cable.

### Cut the LED Strip

![ledstrip_cut_st0](../../../assets/NanoKVM/pro/ledstrip/ledstrip_cut_st0.jpg)

Cut the LED strip according to the screen’s width and height.

> The number of LEDs on opposite sides must remain consistent.

Example: Screen height 18 LEDs, width 30 LEDs.

* Segment ①: 18 LEDs
* Segment ②: 30 LEDs
* Segment ③: 18 LEDs
* Segment ④: 30 LEDs

When cutting, make sure to cut along the red line (the midpoint between contacts):

### Open the Adapter Connector

In the image below, the right side shows the **side view** of the adapter connector. Pry open the connector at the red-marked area, resulting in the state shown on the left:

### Insert the Cables

Insert the LED strip and right-angle cable into opposite sides of the adapter connector, ensuring that the metal contacts align with the bridging metal inside the connector. Close the connector to secure.

Connect the other end of the right-angle cable. **Ensure that the arrow direction on the LED strip (signal flow direction) remains consistent**.
Repeat this process until all strips are connected.
