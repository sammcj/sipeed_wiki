## Introduction

[**nomad-playbook**](https://github.com/caiodelgadonew/nomad-playbook) is an automated deployment script written with Ansible, designed to quickly set up a cluster environment based on HashiCorp Nomad and Consul. This project supports one-click deployment of a single-server Nomad/Consul cluster, using Podman (or optionally Docker) as the container runtime. It is ideal for rapid deployment and testing of portable HomeLab or small edge computing clusters.
