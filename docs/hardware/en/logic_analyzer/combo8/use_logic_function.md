> 1. The maximum transmission bandwidth of SLogic Combo 8 in Linux environment is 320Mb/s, and the typical configuration is 80M@4CH 40M@8CH.
> 2. The maximum transmission bandwidth of SLogic Combo 8 in Windows environment is 160Mb/s, and the typical configuration is 80M@2CH 40M@4CH.
> 3. If there is a disconnection during the startup process of the host software, please rescan and reconnect the device before performing other operations, otherwise it may lead to software crashes.

### Quick Start

#### Pin Connections

![slogic_line_order](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/slogic_line_order.png)

The above diagram shows the pinout for the 8 channels of SLogic. Connect the target device's test signal points to any available CH port on SLogic, and ensure that the ground of the target device is connected to the ground of SLogic.

> Note: The GND line of the SLogic needs to be as close as possible to the location of the point to be measured, even 1cm closer may increase the quality of the sample.

#### Downloading and Running the Host Computer

#### Ready to Sample

1. Set the sampling parameters

   The following figure sets the number of channels to **8**, the number of samples to **1M samples**, and the sampling rate to **10Mhz**. At this time the **sampling time** is 1M / 10Mhz = 0.1s

   ![equ_selec_complete_of_pulseview](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/equ_selec_complete_of_pulseview.png)

#### Start Sampling

1. Click on the "run" button to start sampling.

> Note:If the D7 channel is not used during the sampling process, a level inversion of the channel may be observed, but this is normal and does not affect normal use.

#### Analyze the Sampling Result

1. Open the protocol analysis function

    ![image-20230912150905946](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/open_ptl_field.png)

2. Select the target protocol

    ![image-20230912153947189](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/select_the_target_protocol.png)

3. Configure the protocol parameters

    ![image-20230912152007703](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/config_param_of_protocol.png)

4. Observe the analysis results

    ![image-20230912152105530](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/observe_the_analysis_res.png)

Based on the results of the analysis, let's start debugging.

### Detailed Configuration

#### Sampling Parameters

Sampling parameters include the sample count, sampling frequency, and sampling time.

1. Sample Count: Choose an appropriate value for the sample count based on your requirements.
2. Sampling Frequency: Select a value greater than 10 times the frequency of the signal under test (**recommended** to adhere to Nyquist theorem).
3. Sampling Time: Calculate the sampling time based on the **sample count** and **sampling frequency** using the formula:</br>**Time (seconds) = Sample Count / Sampling Rate**</br>For example, with 1M samples and 1MHz sampling rate, the sampling time would be 1 second.

   ![set_total_sampling_time_of_pulseview](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/set_total_sampling_time_of_pulseview.png)

> After setting the sample count and sampling frequency, placing the mouse cursor over the sample count selection box will display the calculated sampling time for the current parameters.

#### Channel Parameters

Click on a channel's label to set its parameters. Channel parameters include label name, label color, channel waveform display window width, and signal triggering mode.

1. Label Name: Set based on the meaning of the sampled signal to facilitate distinguishing between multiple signals.
2. Label Color: Set according to personal preference to differentiate between different signals during multi-signal sampling.
3. Channel Waveform Display Window Width: Adjust based on the signal amplitude. This value is in pixels. When the signal amplitude changes significantly, increasing this parameter can help observe amplitude changes more clearly.
4. **Signal Triggering Mode**: Choose from **Direct Sample**, **High Level Trigger**, **Low Level Trigger**, **Falling Edge Trigger**, **Rising Edge Trigger**, and **Edge Trigger**.
   (Prior to signal collection, there might be many irrelevant signals. Setting the triggering mode based on the signal pattern can effectively filter out irrelevant signals, thereby improving sampling efficiency and accuracy.)

### Debugging Waveforms

#### View Operations

Through view operations, you can observe waveforms in more detail.

![tag_of_pulseview](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/tag_of_pulseview.png)

**Waveform Zoom**: Use the mouse scroll wheel (middle button) to zoom in and out of the waveform.
**Drag Waveform**: Hold down the left mouse button to drag the waveform display area horizontally and vertically.
**Region Zoom**: Double-click on a specific region to zoom in on that area of the waveform.
**Channel Scroll**: In the waveform display area, use Ctrl + mouse scroll wheel (middle button) to quickly scroll the channels up and down.
**Time Measurement**: You can create marker points by right-clicking the desired position and selecting "Create Marker Here." The software will automatically calculate and display the time length between two marker points on the time axis.
**Adjust Channel Order**: Drag and drop a channel's label to rearrange the order of channels as needed.

#### Protocol Decoding

After capturing the required data, protocol decoding can be used to analyze the data more effectively. Below are the decoding processes for some common protocols.

   ![spi_set](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_spi_set.png)

4. Capture the data and the decoded result will be displayed:

   Example: SPI sends 0x00~0x09 (clock 10MHz, low-active chip select)

   ![spi_10mhz](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_spi_10mhz.jpg)

   Example: SPI sends 0x00~0x09 (clock 26MHz, low-active chip select)

   ![spi_26mhz](./../../../zh/logic_analyzer/combo8/assets/use_logic_function/logic_spi_26mhz.jpg)

### Precautions

When connecting the logic analyzer to the system under test, please note the following precautions:

1. The logic analyzer shares a common ground with the computer. If the system under test is a high-voltage system, be sure to use a "USB isolator" for isolation. Otherwise, there is a risk of damaging the logic analyzer or computer.
2. The GND channel must be reliably connected to the ground of the system under test and kept as short as possible.
3. The signal channels must be securely connected to the test points of the system under test. Avoid haphazard "tapping" that could introduce interference.
4. Improper wiring may introduce glitches that could prevent proper data analysis in the software.
