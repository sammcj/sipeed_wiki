## Getting Started  

Using the **Tang Retro Console** as an example, here‚Äôs how to play games with the Tang Console:  

### Preparation  

  Items needed:  

  - [x] Tang Console, either 138k or 60k version  
  - [x] USB 2.0 drive, or SD card + card reader (Recommended format: FAT32/exFAT, ‚â§32GB)  
  - [x] USB-C OTG adapter with power pass-through (Recommended: USB-C card reader included in the bundle)  
  - [x] Available GBA BIOS (gba_bios.bin)  
  - [x] Latest [**TangCore Release Package**](https://github.com/nand2mario/tangcore/releases)  
  - [x] Game ROMs you want to play (Demo games are preloaded on the uSD card included in the Tang Retro Console Premium bundle)  

### Installing MCU Firmware  

   - For users who purchased any Tang Console bundles, this step is not necessary, as it has been pre-installed at the factory.  

   - If firmware updates are needed in the future, please refer to the guide here: [**Click Here**](../common-doc/update_debugger#additional-notes-for-tang-core)

  > ‚ö† Console will filter the suffix of the game ROM, please be sure to change the game ROM to the corresponding suffix ‚ö†

### Storage Media Content

The contents of the storage media are not differentiated between the **138k console** and the **60k console**. However, the **`gba_bios.bin`** must be downloaded by the user and added manually.  

Place the game ROMs you wish to play into their corresponding directories.

### Hardware Assembly

‚ùóNote: Please assemble all accessories before connecting the power!

1. **Early Bird Ver. Recommended Method** (All accessories for this method are included in the **Tang Console Retro Premium** package):  

   <img src="./assert/retro-console_assembly-1.jpg" width="45%">  

   > Left: USB-OTG card reader + USB-C power supply | Bottom: USB controller **P1** | Top: HDMI output  

   - **Pros**: Simple to setup.  
   - **Cons**: USB controller connection may be unstable in this configuration.  

   - If the USB controller is not recognized (especially after switching emulator cores), users may need to repeatedly reconnect the USB controller several times.  

   - ***Retail Ver.**  of Tang Console does not need to use OTG card reader, just insert the uSD card into the built-in card slot. Because the built-in card slot of **Retail Ver.** is connected to **BL616** through a MUX.*

   <br>

2. **Recommended Method for Retail Version**

   <img src="./assert/retro-console_assembly-0.jpg" width="45%">  

   > Bottom Left: USB-OTG | Top Left: USB-C Power Supply | Bottom: USB Controller **P1** | Top Right: HDMI Output  

   - **Pros**: MOST Simple setup.  
   - **Cons**: USB controller connection may be unstable in this configuration.  

   - If the USB controller is not recognized (especially after switching emulator cores), users may need to repeatedly reconnect the USB controller several times.  

   - The controller can be connected directly to the Console's USB port or via USB-OTG to the BL616. 
   
   - USB OTG is not necessary to assemble, depends on your use.

### Important Notes  

| Item             | Details                                                                                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Power Supply** | Use a power adapter with at least **5V/2A**. Avoid exceeding **+5.5V** or dropping below **+3.4V**.          |
| **Static**       | Avoid static discharge on the PCBA. Ground yourself before touching.                                         |
| **Voltage**      | Ensure GPIO pins are at **3.3V** levels; higher voltages can damage the PCBA.                                |
| **FPC Connector**| Insert FPC cables carefully. Ensure the 1st PIN direction is correct.                                        |
| **Connecting**   | Only handle connections with the device fully powered off, except USB-A controller and drives.               |
| **USB Controller** | If the controller is unresponsive, reconnect several times.                                               |
| **Short Circuits**| Avoid liquid or metal contact with the PCBA during power-on to prevent damage.                              |

## FAQ  

### USB Controller Not Responding  

<details>  
<summary><font color="#4F84FF">Click to View Details</font></summary>  
<br>  

1. This is a known issue in *tangcore* *version* `0.8`, please unplug and replug the USB controller, then try again.  
2. The stability issue with USB-A controllers connected to the front of the Console will be resolved in future firmware updates.  
3. The most stable connection method currently is the PMOD DS2 controller.
4. Please pay attention to the silkscreen mark on the USB port. The USB port on the right is marked as P2. Some games can only be operated with the P1 controller(The same applies when using a DS2 controller).

### UI Disappears After Pressing the MODE Key  

<details>  
<summary><font color="#4F84FF">Click to View Details</font></summary>  
<br>  

1. This is a known issue in *tangcore* *version* `0.8`, and will be resolved in future firmware updates.  
2. If the cursor `>` is still visible, try using the controller to navigate pages or return to the previous menu to force a UI refresh.  

</details>

### "Waiting for USB drive..." Message After Powering On  

<details>  
<summary><font color="#4F84FF">Click to View Details</font></summary>  
<br>  

1. If using a USB HUB, this might indicate HUB incompatibility.  
2. Ensure the USB drive/card reader is properly connected.  
3. Make sure the USB drive/card reader is **‚â§32GB** and formatted as **FAT32/exFAT**.

### GBATang Error: `Cannot find /gba_bios.bin...`  

<details>  
<summary><font color="#4F84FF">Click to View Details</font></summary>  
<br>  

1. This indicates that the **`/GBA` directory** on the USB drive or storage card is missing the original GBA BIOS, which may cause compatibility issues with certain ROMs.  
2. Due to copyright restrictions, we cannot provide this file. You need to obtain the `gba_bios.bin` yourself and place it in the correct location.  

   <img src="./assert/retro-console_menu5.jpg" width="45%">  

</details>  

### The ***`Options`*** option in the main menu screen is inaccessible

<details>
<summary><font color="#4F84FF">Click to view details</font></summary>
<br>

1. This is because **[nand2mario](https://github.com/nand2mario)** has not yet implemented this functionality in *tangcore* *version* `0.8` & `0.9`.
2. This feature will be gradually implemented in future updates.
